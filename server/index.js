// Local Express OCR proxy (deprecated)
//
// This file was used during early development as a local Express-based
// OCR proxy that forwarded uploads to OCR.space. The project now uses a
// serverless function at `api/ocr.js` for deployments (Vercel).
//
// Leaving this file as a deprecated placeholder in the repo to avoid
// accidental usage. If you want to remove it entirely, delete this file.

console.log('server/index.js is deprecated — use api/ocr.js (serverless)')
